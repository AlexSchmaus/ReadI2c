# ReadI2c
Testing reading I2C / IIC data

This program is from Aug 2020

My first adventures with handling data to and from the I2C bus with an Arduino. This script would get the current tempatue from a sensor, display it
on a small OLED screen, and also set a RGB LED to a color, based on the room's tempature. 

I was also working on adding a real time clock to this as well.
